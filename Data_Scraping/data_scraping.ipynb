Both Karanataka and Madhya Pradesh were formed on 1st November 1956. In fact, even Chattisgarh was formed on 1st November 2000. Harayana on 1st November 1966. Punjab on 1st November 1966. I have never seen these celebrations in MP. No native Indori of Bhopali celebrates this day. It's the same in Chattisgarh. I have barely come across such kind of celebrations in Raipur, the capital of Chattisgarh. No such wide scale celebrations in Harayana and Punjab either. Heck, 1st November isn't even a state holiday in most of the above-mentioned states. It's surprisingly the same in most northern states on their respective formation dates. And I have always wondered why. The sentiment of state and regional pride is almost entirely absent in north. The only other place I have seen state formation day being celebrated is Maharashtra. \\n\\nEdit: Foundations of Kerala and Tamil Nadu were also laid on 1st November 1956. I have been to Kerala and have few friends from there. From what I know, foundation day celebrations don't happen at such grand level there, too. Unsure of Tamil Nadu.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'As a Telugu, I have always seen Marathis as a sort of anomaly in the Deccan and South Indian macro-region. Telugus have much in common with their Dravidian neighbors to the south and west (Tamils and Kannadigas), as well as to the Gonds living to the north in Bastar. However, I cannot think of much that Telugus have in common with Marathis, besides a few superficial similarities such as the usage of \"Rao\" in personal names. Historically, there were also quite few political and cultural relations between Telugu states and Marathi states, especially when compared to relations between Telugus and Kannadigas, or between Telugus and Tamils. For example, Telugu and Kannada were so close that until the 12th century, they used the exact same script, and even today the Telugu and Kannada scripts are mutually legible to a considerable degree (though the languages themselves are quite distinct). In contrast, Marathis use Nagari script just like North Indians, which is illegible to Kannadigas and Telugus. Likewise, there was extensive intercourse between Telugus and Tamils, especially during the Vijayanagara period when Telugu became the court language at places like Gingee and Madurai. All three Dravidian nations (Telugus, Tamils, and Kannadigas) were represented to some degree in the Vijayanagara empire, but Marathis were not represented at all. \\n\\nOverall, I think Marathis would be better classified as \"West Indians\" and grouped with Gujaratis and Malavis (people of Malwa, in western MP) rather than with Telugus and Kannadigas in South India.

Telugus have much in common with their Dravidian neighbors to the south and west (Tamils and Kannadigas), as well as to the Gonds living to the north in Bastar. However, I cannot think of much that Telugus have in common with Marathis, besides a few superficial similarities such as the usage of \"Rao\" in personal names. Historically, there were also quite few political and cultural relations between Telugu states and Marathi states, especially when compared to relations between Telugus and Kannadigas, or between Telugus and Tamils. For example, Telugu and Kannada were so close that until the 12th century, they used the exact same script, and even today the Telugu and Kannada scripts are mutually legible to a considerable degree (though the languages themselves are quite distinct). In contrast, Marathis use Nagari script just like North Indians, which is illegible to Kannadigas and Telugus. Likewise, there was extensive intercourse between Telugus and Tamils, especially during the Vijayanagara period when Telugu became the court language at places like Gingee and Madurai. All three Dravidian nations (Telugus, Tamils, and Kannadigas) were represented to some degree in the Vijayanagara empire, but Marathis were not represented at all. \\n\\nOverall, I think Marathis would be better classified as \"West Indians\" and grouped with Gujaratis and Malavis (people of Malwa, in western MP) rather than with Telugus and Kannadigas in South India.

There is no proper planning, youngsters are supervisors and 50 plus aged teachers are on field duty.

I often dress casually, loose full sleeve shirt and jeans (which I wore entire week), during exams I am more often checked for cheats than other guy who look smart, even if they are caught they are told 'didn't expect this from you' and are let go.\\n\\nWhat are your observations?

       "  'body': 'Delaying the Census aids politicisation of delimitation issue \\n\\nPublished - March 24, 2025 12:20 am IST\\n\\n\\nThe impressive gathering in Chennai, on March 22, 2025, which brought together leaders from several States — including four Chief Ministers — for the inaugural meeting of the Joint Action Committee (JAC) on Fair Delimitation, sent a clear message: any delimitation exercise based solely on the current population figures is unacceptable. The meeting’s primary demand — to extend the freeze on the number of parliamentary constituencies based on the 1971 Census for another 25 years — echoes a similar resolution passed at a recent meeting of parties in Tamil Nadu, which proposed a 30-year extension. This concept of a freeze is not new; it was implemented through the 42nd Amendment (until 2000) and extended again via the 84th Amendment (until 2026). Rightly, the JAC emphasised that States which have successfully implemented family planning should not be penalised with reduced parliamentary representation. This concern, which is particularly prominent in the South, should not be dismissed as a regional issue, despite the strong southern presence at the meeting, which was hosted by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin and attended by Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy, and Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar. The meeting also saw participation from outside the South, including Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann and Odisha’s former Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, who, in an online address, reinforced the message against punishing States for effective population control measures. It is after a long time that parties across regions and ideologies are uniting on a substantive issue — representative democracy — rather than forming opportunistic electoral coalitions that lack policy coherence.',\n",

The Feminist movement never really made it into India barring some maybe on-line sentiments or high-class part of society.

Bike taxis are obviously super bad for them, since they will take away a lot of business from them which would otherwise be compelled to come to them. They are also right in that bike taxis are not regulated as such, unlike the Autos.\\n\\nI basically want to discuss with you guys about what is the right direction for this?

There is no proper planning, youngsters are supervisors and 50 plus aged teachers are on field duty. No clear information on if family person is dead and has name in ration card, or family person in in abroad or missing what to be filled. Some people had finished the survey and they are bringing new rules everyday making them wander again and again to the survey. Teachers are struggling in hot sun.

Some are denied services, jobs, or fair treatment unless they “comply.”\\n\\nIs this really the India our freedom fighters dreamed of — one where we’re free from colonial rule but bound by regional chauvinism? Didn’t we fight for unity in diversity?\\n\\nIndia is a country of 22 official languages and hundreds of dialects. Diversity is our strength, but it’s becoming a wedge.

       "  'body': \"It's a question that was raised in Maharashtra, and now will probably be raised in Karnataka now. Is it ok for Bike Taxis to be allowed to play, or should Autorickshaws be allowed to remain the cheapest mode of transport.\\n\\nTo be very fair, I'm not sure I would apply this to Mumbai, because in my experience all over India, Mumbai is the only place with somewhat reasonable rates. I say this because I paid almost the same amount for a cab to go 5km in Bangalore that I did for about 20km in Mumbai. I also saw a lot of people in Bangalore express the highest amount of anxiety when it came to booking cabs. \\n\\nI think for a city like Bangalore, or even Jamshedpur, which was another place with insane rates, bike taxis are almost a necessity. The cost of taxis and even Autorickshaws seems to be dependent on the whims of the operator of the vehicle.\\n\\nOn the other hand, I see the point of Auto unions, such that they are. Bike taxis are obviously super bad for them, since they will take away a lot of business from them which would otherwise be compelled to come to them. They are also right in that bike taxis are not regulated as such, unlike the Autos.\\n\\nI basically want to discuss with you guys about what is the right direction for this? On one hand, the employment of auto drivers and the lack of regulation for bike taxis is important. However, when auto drivers are given a free reign, it seems to lead to adverse outcomes for the people.\",\n",

This isn't a pipe dream - it's the potential of free trade.\\n\\nBy lowering trade barriers, we can:\\n\\n* **Create jobs through unexpected channels:** Free trade doesn't just mean factories competing on price. It can lead to a boom in service industries like logistics, finance, and IT, which create a vast number of high-paying jobs. Look at how countries like the US and UK benefitted in this way.\\n* **Boost our economy:** A level playing field lets Indian businesses thrive internationally. This translates to more jobs and a higher standard of living for all.\\n* **Fuel innovation:** When our companies face global competition, they're pushed to innovate and improve. This benefits consumers with better products and keeps India at the forefront of technological advancement.\\n* **Promote peace:** When nations trade freely, they become economically interdependent. This fosters dialogue and reduces the risk of conflict. A strong trading relationship with China, for example, benefits both economies and promotes regional stability.\\n\\n**Think about it:** We already have free trade between Indian states.  Would Karnataka benefit by putting up trade barriers against Tamil Nadu?  Of course not!  Free trade within India has been a success story.  Why not take that success and expand it to the whole world?\\n\\nThe rest of the world is embracing free trade, and reaping the rewards. Look at the incredible growth of Vietnam, a country that's deeply integrated with the global market. They started off at the same level as India in the year 2000. Now their GDP per capita is almost double India's! \\n\\nWe should talk more about free trade as a key to structural reforms and India's rise.\",\n",

The agreement is on an e-stamp costing Rs. 100, and I read somewhere that in Karnataka, for a lease agreement of 11 months, the stamp duty is generally calculated as 2% of the average annual rent plus the average premium (if any) payable over the lease term.

       "  'body': 'I am 23 and I recently moved to Karnataka to prepare for my pg exam preparation. At first I never faced any problem I learned a little bit of kannada also like numbers , greetings , directions etc , but last month I went to a mess the mess lady started shouting when I asked for price she said “ only Kannada people eat here” I thought it’s fine every state has these kinds of people . But yesterday when I was purchasing groceries I asked a gentleman to move a side “ dayavittu nangge ondu kade kodi “ (forgive my broken Kannada)he gave me side and then called me and told me sweet dreams then I ignored and proceeded with my purchasing the from far he pointed his fingers making a gun . I asked him Whats the problem . He got angry , i even told the shopkeeper to help me he refrained then few locals came in I explained them they told me even if he shouts at you you listen. Because you came from another state eating. Our food stealing our jobs . They told me to basically shut up even though I spoke a lil bit Kannada they told me to speak everything in Kannada or shut up .\\nSo coming back to my question why is Karnataka becoming so racial and Abusive to people speaking other languages??',\n",

My Kannada is not really good and I cant speak it fluently, so I asked him if I could explain in English as my Kannada is not good, he responded in Kannada saying \"Sir you are in Karnataka so speak Kannada\" I hung up because that dude was of no use.

       "  'body': 'Lately, there’s been a noticeable rise in anti-Hindi sentiment in South India. Many people now see Hindi as a tool of imposition rather than just another Indian language. While it’s completely understandable to take pride in regional languages like Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam, outright rejecting Hindi creates an unnecessary divide. India has always been a multilingual country, and knowing Hindi doesn’t mean losing one’s own language or culture.\\n\\nThe argument against Hindi is often based on the fear that it will replace regional languages, but in reality, that’s not happening. People in the North also speak their own dialects alongside Hindi, just as South Indians speak their mother tongues alongside English. Hindi is simply an additional way to communicate, making it easier to interact with people across states. Whether it’s for jobs, travel, or just connecting with more Indians, knowing Hindi is an advantage, not a disadvantage.\\n\\nHating a language only widens the gap between regions. Instead of seeing Hindi as a threat, why not see it as a way to bring people closer? Just as Hindi speakers should respect South Indian languages, South Indians can also be open to Hindi—not as an imposition, but as a language that helps us stay connected as one nation.\\n\\nALSO, NO LANGUAGE SHOULD BE IMPOSED ON ANYONE, WHATSOEVER!!',\n",

But yesterday when I was purchasing groceries I asked a gentleman to move a side “ dayavittu nangge ondu kade kodi “ (forgive my broken Kannada)he gave me side and then called me and told me sweet dreams then I ignored and proceeded with my purchasing the from far he pointed his fingers making a gun . I asked him Whats the problem . He got angry , i even told the shopkeeper to help me he refrained then few locals came in I explained them they told me even if he shouts at you you listen. Because you came from another state eating. Our food stealing our jobs .

Why would these people need to say common words like this in English?\\n\\nI mean I know plenty of people who speak languages like Spanish, Persian, and Vietnamese but I never hear them randomly interject English words into their language.

They speak classical Marathi which is very very close to Kannada and Telugu (Satara is like Kannada, solapur is like Telugu)\\nfacial features similar to southerners as well\\n\\nregions: Pune Division (maybe not Pune City though, since it is modernized, but Pune Region is different)\\n  Marathwada Division: Also quite similar to south\\n\\nIMO Satara and Solapur is as close as it gets. Also, people address brothers as Anna sometimes, just like in south. \\n\\n\\n\\n- Central India\\ndefinitely the Vidarbha region . The Marathi they speak is closer to Hindi and Nagpur has always had a Hindi presence because of this.\\n\\nit’s weird though because MP is like Mh, but Mh is like Mp\\n\\n\\n\\n- West India\\n\\nprobably the north Mh region, including Konkan (Mumbai, raigad, kolhapur, etc)\\nthey speak a Marathi similar to Gujarati and facial similarities with Gujaratis are there.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn my opinion Maharashtra can’t be considered part of one region. Too diverse. Someone from Satara would have more in common with a Kannadigga than a Mumbaikar. Someone from Nagpur would have more in common with a Indori than a Solhapurkar.\\n\\n\\nHonestly, I don’t care if you guys deny this.

It is said that people came back in droves from cities to villages to start farming after being inspired by this movie. \\n* He has acted in 208 movies. All as the lead with 95% of them being box office hits. \\n* He won a national award for playback singing. \\n* He won a doctorate for acting. He was also the first Indian theatre personality to be awarded as Kentucky Colonel by the USA. \\n* He has acted in a single language, Kannada, for over 50 years. \\n* He has over 5000 fan association all over the world and there are over 2000 statues of him. \\n* All his 208 films had a U certificate. \\n* He never dabbled in politics even though the only time he did during the Gokak agitation, there was an ocean of people ready to do what he said. \\n* He has played every role you can imagine. From mythological and historical characters like Krishna, Raghavendra Swamy, Arjuna, Santa Tukaram, Purandara Dasa, Bedara Kannappa, Krishna Devaraya to playing an adaption of James Bond, he has done it all. \\n\\nThe legend lives on even today.

I got married and shifted to Banglore almost 4 years back. We shifted to a rent apartment in a particular area because we thought the metro work would be completed in a year or maximum 2. The metro work is still going on and I doubt they will finish the work this year. U have to wave at the bus inspite of standing at the bus stand. Bus drivers drive the bus in middle lane so u have to literally go to the road and wave at the bus. Most of the time the bus route on the bus is written Kannada so one has to learn Kannada. I dont mind learning Kannada but one has to understand that its a difficult language to learn and I am trying to learn. You dont know English/Hindi thats okay but be kind and respectful to the person who cannot communicate with you in Kannada. I have stayed in Mumbai & Pune before but I never found it difficult to communicate despite of not knowing the language. The roads are so bad in ORR that my husband has developed cervical pain in spine. Why am I still living in this city? The day we get a good paying job in some other city we would move there happily.',\n",

And the selected movies are based upon a theme for a month. The movies are not our regular OTT or mainstream movies, almost all of them are off beat hidden gems! \\n\\nFor current month the theme is Urbanism. The very last Sunday the discussion was on a documentary called The World Before Your Feet. It was about a guy named Matt Green, who has walked every street in New York City, which is about 8000 miles! To our surprise the moderators had invited him to join the conversation with us, where he spoke about his purpose and the reason he walked all over the city. Also one the Malayalam film industry's finest directors, Mr. Adoor Gopalakrishnan had joined us for the discussion on his film Anantaram.\\n\\nEven on this Sunday they have a discussion regarding the movie Ek Ghar, directed by the notable Kannada filmmaker Mr. Girish Kasaravalli, and he is joining us as the chief panelist! I personally, and the film club would love to have more movie freaks take notice of their film related activities, and join us on these wonderful movie discussions every weekend! The club's name is The Parallel Cinema Club, you can catch up with them on Insta, FB, Twitter with the name theparallelcinemaclub. They are mostly active on Telegram.\",\n",

They speak classical Marathi which is very very close to Kannada and Telugu (Satara is like Kannada, solapur is like Telugu)\\nfacial features similar to southerners as well\\n\\nregions: Pune Division (maybe not Pune City though, since it is modernized, but Pune Region is different)\\n  Marathwada Division: Also quite similar to south\\n\\nIMO Satara and Solapur is as close as it gets. Also, people address brothers as Anna sometimes, just like in south. \\n\\n\\n\\n- Central India\\ndefinitely the Vidarbha region . The Marathi they speak is closer to Hindi and Nagpur has always had a Hindi presence because of this.\\n\\nit’s weird though because MP is like Mh, but Mh is like Mp\\n\\n\\n\\n- West India\\n\\nprobably the north Mh region, including Konkan (Mumbai, raigad, kolhapur, etc)\\nthey speak a Marathi similar to Gujarati and facial similarities with Gujaratis are there.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn my opinion Maharashtra can’t be considered part of one region. Too diverse. Someone from Satara would have more in common with a Kannadigga than a Mumbaikar. Someone from Nagpur would have more in common with a Indori than a Solhapurkar.\\n\\n\\nHonestly, I don’t care if you guys deny this.

       "  'body': 'As a Telugu, I have always seen Marathis as a sort of anomaly in the Deccan and South Indian macro-region. Telugus have much in common with their Dravidian neighbors to the south and west (Tamils and Kannadigas), as well as to the Gonds living to the north in Bastar. However, I cannot think of much that Telugus have in common with Marathis, besides a few superficial similarities such as the usage of \"Rao\" in personal names. Historically, there were also quite few political and cultural relations between Telugu states and Marathi states, especially when compared to relations between Telugus and Kannadigas, or between Telugus and Tamils. For example, Telugu and Kannada were so close that until the 12th century, they used the exact same script, and even today the Telugu and Kannada scripts are mutually legible to a considerable degree (though the languages themselves are quite distinct). In contrast, Marathis use Nagari script just like North Indians, which is illegible to Kannadigas and Telugus. Likewise, there was extensive intercourse between Telugus and Tamils, especially during the Vijayanagara period when Telugu became the court language at places like Gingee and Madurai. All three Dravidian nations (Telugus, Tamils, and Kannadigas) were represented to some degree in the Vijayanagara empire, but Marathis were not represented at all. \\n\\nOverall, I think Marathis would be better classified as \"West Indians\" and grouped with Gujaratis and Malavis (people of Malwa, in western MP) rather than with Telugus and Kannadigas in South India.

By attacking him with legal affairs, we are amplifying the very regional insecurity he was pointing out, ironically worsening the cultural polarization he referenced.\\n\\nThis case seems like a litmus test for how much nuance public discourse in India can currently tolerate. Not every controversial or clumsy statement should be criminalized. Instead of an FIR, a healthier response might’ve been counter speech, people or politicians on social media could have talked about the openness of Kannada culture, maybe even invited him to perform again rather than using courts as cultural enforcement mechanisms.\\n\\nThe politicians will get their votes, Sonu Nigam is rich enough to shield himself from legal troubles, but tomorrow for god's sake you, an average citizen will express dissent, the same system you support today will not think twice before crushing you.\\n\\nHave a good day\",\n",

However, KGF should be seen as a stepping stone for better projects.\\n\\nA few points in favour of KGF:\\n\\n1. As far as conventional (popcorn) Kannada cinema is concerned, this is our magnum opus. It’s booked our place on the masala map so far dominated by Telugu, Tamil & Hindi cinema.\\n\\n2. As far as intellectual/parallel cinema is concerned, the New Wave of Kannada Cinema is fresh, vibrant & thriving. What’s more is that as we type all this out, more curious non-Kannadigas are googling Kannada movies & probably statistically falling for our less-marketed, but smarter offerings as well as whatever else is similar to KGF. So we have KGF to thank for that.\\n\\n3. It’s brought together North+South industries in ways that Baahubali which was bigger, didn’t. Yes, RRR with Ajay Devgan came first, but this has a pan-India story, more of the Northern presence than ever seen before, & isn’t restricted to regional freedom-fighters(not like that hindered the success of RRR!).\\n\\n4. The section of Indian cinema-lovers that’s looking to shun Bollywood for whatever reasons, now has something else to fixate on, instead.\\n\\n\\n5. It’s high-octane hero-worship action, whistle worthy stuff, & all that laymen miss from before the COVID era. It (along with TKF, Pushpa & RRR) have brought the masses back to the Cinemas.

       "  'body': 'Many out here are calling it over-rated, & to particular perspectives on how Cinema should be made, it is valid judgement. However, KGF should be seen as a stepping stone for better projects.\\n\\nA few points in favour of KGF:\\n\\n1. As far as conventional (popcorn) Kannada cinema is concerned, this is our magnum opus. It’s booked our place on the masala map so far dominated by Telugu, Tamil & Hindi cinema.\\n\\n2. As far as intellectual/parallel cinema is concerned, the New Wave of Kannada Cinema is fresh, vibrant & thriving. What’s more is that as we type all this out, more curious non-Kannadigas are googling Kannada movies & probably statistically falling for our less-marketed, but smarter offerings as well as whatever else is similar to KGF. So we have KGF to thank for that.\\n\\n3. It’s brought together North+South industries in ways that Baahubali which was bigger, didn’t. Yes, RRR with Ajay Devgan came first, but this has a pan-India story, more of the Northern presence than ever seen before, & isn’t restricted to regional freedom-fighters(not like that hindered the success of RRR!).\\n\\n4. The section of Indian cinema-lovers that’s looking to shun Bollywood for whatever reasons, now has something else to fixate on, instead.\\n\\n\\n5. It’s high-octane hero-worship action, whistle worthy stuff, & all that laymen miss from before the COVID era. It (along with TKF, Pushpa & RRR) have brought the masses back to the Cinemas. These common folk can’t be blamed for thronging to what their hearts desire.\\n\\nMany liked it, so live & let live, I say. Jai Karnataka💛❤️, Jai Hind🇮🇳, JSR🧡.',\n",

       "  'body': \"A recent survey conducted by People's Pulse and reported by Deccan Herald indicates that if Karnataka were to hold assembly elections today, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) could secure a majority, marking a significant shift from the 2023 election results. \\n\\nSurvey Findings\\n\\nBJP: Projected to win between 136 and 159 seats out of 224, surpassing the majority threshold of 113 seats.\\n\\nIndian National Congress (INC): Expected to secure between 62 and 82 seats.\\n\\nJanata Dal (Secular) [JD(S)]: Anticipated to win 3 to 6 seats.\\n\\nOthers: Projected to obtain 0 seats. \\n\\n\\nThis survey, conducted in May 2025 with a sample size of 10,481 respondents, suggests a notable resurgence for the BJP in Karnataka.  In contrast, during the 2023 assembly elections, the Congress achieved a significant victory, winning 135 seats, while the BJP and JD(S) secured 66 and 19 seats, respectively.  \\n\\nFactors Influencing the Shift\\n\\nThe potential swing in voter sentiment may be attributed to several factors: \\n\\nBJP-JD(S) Alliance: The collaboration between BJP and JD(S) appears to have consolidated their voter base, potentially enhancing their combined electoral strength.  \\n\\nVoter Behavior Patterns: Historically, Karnataka voters have demonstrated different preferences in state and national elections.  For instance, during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP-JD(S) alliance led in 142 assembly segments, despite Congress's previous state-level success.  \\n\\nImplementation of Congress's Promises: While the Congress government, led by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, implemented key promises such as free bus rides for women and financial allowances for homemakers, the long-term impact of these initiatives on voter satisfaction remains to be fully assessed.  \\n\\n\\nIn summary, the survey indicates a potential shift in Karnataka's political landscape, with the BJP poised for a comeback if elections were held today.  However, it's essential to consider the dynamic nature of voter preferences and the evolving political context when interpreting these findings. \\n\\n\\nhttps://www.deccanherald.com/india/karnataka/bengaluru/bjp-expected-to-come-back-to-power-in-karnataka-if-assembly-elections-held-today-survey-3555227\",\n",

       "  'body': \"A recent survey conducted by People's Pulse and reported by Deccan Herald indicates that if Karnataka were to hold assembly elections today, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) could secure a majority, marking a significant shift from the 2023 election results. \\n\\nSurvey Findings\\n\\nBJP: Projected to win between 136 and 159 seats out of 224, surpassing the majority threshold of 113 seats.\\n\\nIndian National Congress (INC): Expected to secure between 62 and 82 seats.\\n\\nJanata Dal (Secular) [JD(S)]: Anticipated to win 3 to 6 seats.\\n\\nOthers: Projected to obtain 0 seats. \\n\\n\\nThis survey, conducted in May 2025 with a sample size of 10,481 respondents, suggests a notable resurgence for the BJP in Karnataka.  In contrast, during the 2023 assembly elections, the Congress achieved a significant victory, winning 135 seats, while the BJP and JD(S) secured 66 and 19 seats, respectively.  \\n\\nFactors Influencing the Shift\\n\\nThe potential swing in voter sentiment may be attributed to several factors: \\n\\nBJP-JD(S) Alliance: The collaboration between BJP and JD(S) appears to have consolidated their voter base, potentially enhancing their combined electoral strength.  \\n\\nVoter Behavior Patterns: Historically, Karnataka voters have demonstrated different preferences in state and national elections.  For instance, during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP-JD(S) alliance led in 142 assembly segments, despite Congress's previous state-level success.  \\n\\nImplementation of Congress's Promises: While the Congress government, led by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, implemented key promises such as free bus rides for women and financial allowances for homemakers, the long-term impact of these initiatives on voter satisfaction remains to be fully assessed.  \\n\\n\\nIn summary, the survey indicates a potential shift in Karnataka's political landscape, with the BJP poised for a comeback if elections were held today.  However, it's essential to consider the dynamic nature of voter preferences and the evolving political context when interpreting these findings. \\n\\n\\nhttps://www.deccanherald.com/india/karnataka/bengaluru/bjp-expected-to-come-back-to-power-in-karnataka-if-assembly-elections-held-today-survey-3555227\",\n",

It tries to portray the Siddis as African slaves who willingly took up Islam and Christianity, but portrays Hinduism as a backwards, caste-ridden ideology that provides little room for others. This is blatantly false. The Siddis are a group of Africans, possibly of Ethiopian origins who were enslaved by Islamic empires first, then later by Portuguese empires. They were brutally enslaved and brought over to India, they most certainly did not willingly take up Christianity or Islam. \\n\\nIf you look at Wikipedia, this is what it says.\\n\\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddi#:~:text=The%20Siddi%20(pronounced%20%5Bs%C9%AAd%CC%AAd%CC%AAi%5D,indentured%20servants%2C%20slaves%20and%20mercenaries.\\n\\nIt says that the largest group of Siddis in Karnataka are Hindus. This was the only religion that they took up willingly. Siddis are an African group that was enslaved brutally and brought to India by the Islamic empires. Islam was forced upon them. The same happened with the Catholic Portuguese rulers. Many of them chose Hinduism willingly, and blended it with their own traditional African beliefs that they were forced to abandon by Christians and Muslims, because Hinduism allows you to blend in whatever you want. \\n\\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thenewsminute.com/article/meet-shantaram-budna-karnatakas-first-mlc-siddi-community-african-descent-129655%3famp\\n\\nHere, there is even an article on a Siddi RSS member who became MLC. \\n\\nThis is a community many people outside of Karnataka are unfamiliar with.

What relationship do MPs have with MLAs ?(I know MPs are elected during the general election of the country and represent their constituencies but I don't know if they somehow communicate with the state government i.e. with MLAs.)\\n\\n2. What are the powers of said MPs and MLAs w.r.t. the governance within their state? My impression is that MPs have no say in state governance, but it just seems so unproductive to not have dialog between state representatives in the parliament and the state government's own representatives.\\n\\n3. How does an ideal MP and MLA run things and WHAT DO THEY ACTUALLY DO? Honestly, I just see them when they campaign and if left to my ignorance, I'd think they don't do anything but campaign.\\n\\n4. How do state elections work? (specifically Karnataka because I'm assuming there's differences) \\n\\n5. Why do I see tickets being given to -- as far as we know -- politically illiterate people all the time? I mean, I know why, but it seems to have become so normal that no one questions it? Why isn't there an outrage when you see tickets being given to such people?\\n\\nThat's about it.\\n\\nP.S. I apologise for my complete ignorance in such matters. I've only just begun looking into politics. I tried looking these up but I simply get more doubts and so I thought a place like reddit where I can ask someone to clarify what they mean was the best place to ask.

I thought this warranted its own post.\\n\\nStop telling people that they're wrong to fight for what they believe in. This is the high handed attitude that the left has propagated for a large portion of India's independent history.\\n\\nThis mindset is the true problem. Asking people to overcome differences like it is a minor disagreement on a cricket field. you can rant all you want but differences will always exist. \\n\\nUnity should exist INSPITE of these differences. This kind of unity already exists all around. Among many things mutual respect goes a long way to achieve unity.   \\n  \\nFor instance a large portion have Jnana Peetha awards for Kannada literature have been awarded to authors who are not native Kannadigas and yet contributed to Kannada literature.\\n\\nThe call should be for unity inspite of our differences. There will be a time and place to settle our differences and arrive at an equitable ground.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'Summary:\\n\\nIn her opinion piece, Zakia Soman highlights how Muslim women demanding justice continue to face resistance from both conservative religious elements and political liberals in India. Using the example of Banu Mushtaq’s International Booker Prize-winning book Heart Lamp, Soman emphasizes how the voices of Muslim women are authentic, rooted in real struggle, and not part of any political conspiracy. Mushtaq’s work, originally in Kannada, portrays the resilience of women negotiating patriarchy.\\n\\nSoman argues that Muslim women suffer dual marginalisation — from patriarchal norms within the community and communal discrimination outside. Unlike Hindu and Christian women, Muslim women lack codified and reformed personal laws, making them more vulnerable in family and legal matters. The article criticises both religious conservatives who label these women as “bad women” and political actors who ignore their plight in the current polarised climate. Soman calls for attention to this injustice and the broader challenges of gender and minority rights in India.\\n\\n\\nSource: https://theprint.in/opinion/liberals-dont-want-muslim-women-to-demand-rights-in-the-hindutva-era-theres-no-right-time/2681424/',\n",

Whenever I said, \\'Sir, soulpa adjust madkoli,\\' the customer would light up and sometimes try their best to reply in Hindi or English to help me out. Eventually, I learned Kannada and got fluent. Took me four years, but that’s cool.\"\\n\\n\\nThis is what we need, guys - humility. It can take you far in life.

Part of it should be an effort made by individual to learn another Indian language.\\n\\nNow the \"Hindi first\" move by the Hindi speaking people have alienated the other linguistic groups to an \"anti Hindi\" move.\\n\\nIt\\'s like the native Hindi speakers don\\'t have to learn a new language (other than English) and knowing Hindi is self- fullfilling and other people have to conform to this paradigm.\\n\\nThen native Tamil speakers opposed this movement so they learn only Tamil and English in schools.\\n\\nI don\\'t know how\\'s the situation in Karnataka but in Kerala most students learn Hindi for 6 years by 10th grade.\\n\\nKnowing a second Indian language not just for communication but for literature exposure is crucial for our unity as a nation and our evolution as a civilization.\\n\\nI propose teaching students one more Indian language in schools for at least 3 years which should involve communicative skills as well as exposure to literary works.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t have to be \"a specific language\". If Tamilians hate Hindi they could learn Bengali. Kannadigas can learn Gujarati or Odia and so on.',\n",

       "  'body': 'So felt like drinking coffee yesterday and realized I didnt have milk or coffee powder. Like any responsible Bengaluru citizen, I ordered via swiggy instamart. Soon after i placed it, i saw it was showing not accepting any orders. \\nNo hurry so I let it be. \\nSays 40 mins to delivery! Still.. didnt care and left it. \\n\\nAlmost an hour went by and noticed the order was picked up and the delivery guy was roaming around the area near to my house . Turns out the order picked up didn’t have one item. So our man was going back to pick up the items again. \\n\\nAll this in peak evening traffic in rain. The guy seemed determined and apologetic so I am like dude chill. See if you can get it, otherwise chuck it, it will end up being cancelled. \\n\\n2 hours in, our man, my hero, showed up!\\n\\nHe was still smiling and all sorry! I consoled him and said I will not complain but i need his pic for memory of this story lol. \\n\\nHe is apparently new here (not a kannadiga) and got so lost and disappointed in himself (that he got lost and also couldnt pick up everything in one shot) that he parked by the roadside and actually took 15-20 min to put himself together. He was back with high spirits and I finally got my coffee ☕️ \\n\\nTLDR; ordered on Instamart.. got the order after 2h. Delivery guy was such a determined fellow that it cheered me up! True heroes of the roads..',\n",

       "  'body': 'Soo I go to  this supermarket in my area in Bangalore and I and the owner are pretty close as I shop only from there and I talk to him pretty much everyday, today was just another day.\\n\\n I went to the store on my way home from office, I picked up a few groceries I needed and started taking to owner of the shop who was billing my stuff to in hindi just like I do every single day because the owner is Gujarati and I\\'m Marathi. \\n\\nThis older dude next to me started calling me names, pretty awful ones in kannada. now keep in mind that I know kannada very well so I could understand what this guy was saying I ignored him for the most part and went on to say \"I\\'ll pay by card\" and this stranger said it he said a word that means \"son of a b* I couldn\\'t hold it anymore and I said \\n\\n   \"Uncle nange kannada baruthe\" meaning I understand kannada \\n\\nAnd then he went on to literally abuse me verbally saying if I knew kannada why wouldn\\'t I speak it so on and so fourth and I also said some things back because why should I put up with his shit and he literally grabbed me by my collar and said go back to your Maharastra followed by another very dirty kannada word\\n\\n the owner of the store got him kicked out saying to the guys who worked in the store. And I hate this so much please if let people mind their own fking buisness.',\n",

       "  'body': 'I have grown up reading a lot of hindi books and novels, later on read translations of few marathi and kannada novels. It kinda sucks that I do not see a big presence of indian literature on social media or pop culture.\\n\\nI do have friends who have extensively read a lot of hindi literature, and that gave me an idea of starting with a fun quiz with lots of “Aha” questions that makes the viewers want to read more of some of the greatest hindi books.\\n\\nI am not a social media person at all, however I did create a page on Harishankar Parsai on Instagram where every post that I do at least has 20 lines to read making viewers read and like hindi more.\\n\\nI wanted to share the YouTube video of our first quiz here, but that’s not allowed. In case you’re interested, please comment and I will DM you the link? \\n\\nThe format is inspired by \"Kvizzing with KV\" by Kumar Varun. The editing is quite basic, but the questions will challenge you to think.\\n\\n\"Before fighting for Hindi, read Hindi\"\\n\\nCheers!',\n",
